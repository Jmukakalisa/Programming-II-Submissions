Differnt between JDK, JRE, and JMV

JDK(Java Development Kit) is the surface used to build the Java applications and components.
                                     JDK Consists:   
                                  /       \
                               Compiler    JRE(Java Run-Time Environment)
                                  |          |   
                              .Class file    JMV(Java Virtual Machine) 
                                or(Byte code)/| 
                                              Output

JRE(Java Run-Time Environment) Is JDK part that consist a set of compenents used
to create and Run Java applications.

JMV(Java Virtual Machine) As you can see from the above diagram, JMV is the operating system depending
because it is a part of JRE that receive the compiled .class file or Byte code to produce the output.
